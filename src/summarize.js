// src/summarize.js
// Sends the raw headline candidates to Claude and asks it to pick the top 10
// most significant WORLD stories -- explicitly excluding Bangladesh- and
// Canada-specific news, since those get their own dedicated digests -- and
// write a tight 2-3 sentence summary for each, using only the supplied
// snippet (no fabrication).
//
// Claude is asked to reference each pick by its candidate index rather than
// retyping the title/link -- some aggregator links (e.g. Google News) are
// very long, and having the model reproduce them verbatim risks truncating
// the JSON response before it finishes. The code maps indices back to the
// original candidate data instead.

  return `You are curating a daily world news digest for a busy professional. This reader already receives SEPARATE dedicated daily digests for Bangladesh news and Canadian news, so this digest must NOT include Bangladesh- or Canada-focused stories -- skip any candidate primarily about Bangladesh or Canada, even if it looks important, and pick the next-best genuinely international story instead.

Below are recent headlines pulled from major international news outlets (BBC World News, Al Jazeera, The Guardian World, NPR World, Google News World). Some may be duplicates covering the same story, low-importance filler, or non-news content. Your job:

1. Select up to 10 of the most significant, genuinely newsworthy world stories -- major international politics, conflicts, economy, disasters, diplomacy, etc. -- EXCLUDING anything primarily about Bangladesh or Canada. If fewer than 10 genuinely newsworthy candidates are available, return as many as are available (even just 1) -- never pad with filler.
2. If two entries clearly cover the same underlying story, treat them as one and pick whichever index has the better title/snippet.
3. For each selected story, write a clear, neutral 2-3 sentence summary based ONLY on the title and snippet given below. Do not invent facts, numbers, or quotes that are not implied by the source text.
4. Keep each summary objective and concise -- no editorializing.
5. Aim for a reasonable geographic spread across regions rather than 10 stories from the same conflict/region, unless one story is overwhelmingly dominant in the news cycle.
6. Do NOT repeat the link or URL anywhere -- just reference the candidate's bracketed number.

Candidates:

${list}

CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY a JSON array -- no markdown fences, no preamble, no explanation, no commentary before or after it, even if there is only one candidate or the candidates seem limited. Your entire response must be valid JSON and nothing else. "index" must be the bracketed candidate number [n] above:
[
  {"index": 1, "summary": "2-3 sentence summary"}
]`;
